    <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Less than a century after being discovered by Europeans, parakeets were being kept as pets. British sailors returning from the east coast of Australia, a voyage lead by Captain James Cook, reported seeing huge flocks of small green birds—flocks reportedly so large that they sometimes blocked out the sun. Although they didn’t know at the time, these birds were definitely budgerigars—the pet known as the parakeet here in the US</p>

        <h3>Caretaking</h3>
        <p>Pet parents should spot-clean their parakeet's habitat daily, removing any soiled material and discarded food. Water and food bowls must be washed daily. Substrate, bedding, and habitat liners should be replaced at least once a week, more often if two or more parakeets live in the same habitat)
